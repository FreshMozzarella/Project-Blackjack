<!-- A README.md file with these sections:

☐ <Your game's title>: A description of your game. Background info of the game is a nice touch.

☐ Screenshot(s): Images of your actual game.

Note: if you edit your README.md on the github website editor, you can copy and paste image files directly to your markdown.

☐ Technologies Used: List of the technologies used, e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS...

☐ Getting Started: In this section include the link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important.

☐ Next Steps: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).

Note: Don't underestimate the value of a well crafted README.md. The README.md introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!

☐ Frequent commits (at least 1 every day) dating back to the very beginning of the project. Never delete you repo to "start over".

Commit messages should be in the present tense, e.g., "Style game board" instead of "Styled game board".

Be sure to create the repo on your personal GitHub account and ensure that it is "public". -->
