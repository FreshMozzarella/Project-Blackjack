# Description
    1. The goal of slots is fairly simple: match all three symbols. By increasing your bet, you add 'paylines' or different combinations of ways you can win (if i have a vertical payline it would allow me to win any sequential vertical combinations). 
    2. Once you decide on how many paylines you wish to add, the player hits the spin button and the slots 'spin' and the results are displayed on the screen.
    3. If the player runs out of money, it is game over. If the player manages to reach 5000$, they are rich and the game is also ended.

## History of slot machines
Slots were first founded by a New York company. The first machines used playing cards and were found at bars. There was no payout system--people usually were given free drinks and cigars

☐ <Your game's title>: A description of your game. Background info of the game is a nice touch.

☐ Screenshot(s): Images of your actual game.

Note: if you edit your README.md on the github website editor, you can copy and paste image files directly to your markdown.

☐ Technologies Used: List of the technologies used, e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS...

☐ Getting Started: In this section include the link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important.

☐ Next Steps: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).

Note: Don't underestimate the value of a well crafted README.md. The README.md introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!

☐ Frequent commits (at least 1 every day) dating back to the very beginning of the project. Never delete you repo to "start over".
